Binaries provided at https://rec.ustc.edu.cn/share/4d6a6e00-e04a-11ee-bd1a-2561f5e1cc93.

For self builds, change the proxy settings in the script to suit your need.

## Other platforms

Contact the TA if you meet any trouble running build.py. Contribute to the build script if you have a solution.

Initially I tested the build on Debian 12 with Clang and there are some platfrom specific code left in the script. However later updates are only tested on Windows 11 with msvc. Generally it should run on Debian/Ubuntu with minor fixes.

I have never tested it on MacOS, especially on ARM devices. So contact me ASAP if you really cannot get access to a Windows machine.
